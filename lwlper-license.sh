LispWorks(R) Software License Agreement

Personal Edition

1. License Grant.  This agreement ("Agreement") sets out the terms and
conditions on which LispWorks Ltd ("the Vendor") grants to you, the
Customer ("you") a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the
Vendor's LispWorks Personal Edition software product and related
documentation ("Software") solely for the purpose of developing and
testing applications written in the Lisp programming language.

2. Other Versions and Products. You acknowledge that the media on
which the Software is supplied may contain multiple versions of the
Software as well as the Vendor's other products, including, but not
limited to, the Professional Edition and Enterprise Edition of the
Software. You agree that, unless you have a time limited license for
the purposes of evaluating the Software prior to purchase ("Evaluation
License"), you are licensed to use only the version or product for
which you have paid. If you have an Evaluation License your license
will terminate immediately on the termination of the time-limited
evaluation license key issued to you and in any event not later than
the expiration of one month from the date when your evaluation license
was issued. You agree not to use the Software after this period for
any purpose without obtaining a license from the Vendor. If you order
and pay for licenses for another version or for an optional or
additional product, then such version or product shall become licensed
Software under this Agreement, and your use of it shall be subject to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

3. Non-Commercial Use Only. You may only use the Software for
not-for-profit purposes including teaching and research and personal
use. You may also use the Software for evaluation purposes. Use of the
Software for the development of any commercial software product is
strictly prohibited under the terms of this Agreement and such use
shall serve to automatically terminate the license granted hereunder.

4. Installation. This license allows a single user to use a single
"Installation" of the Software at any one time. For the purposes of
this Agreement, an "Installation" means a single deployment of the
Software whether on a physical computer or on a virtual machine (being
a single instance of an operating system running on physical hardware
where such hardware may also support other operating systems each of
which operates as a virtual computer).

5. Copying, Modification and Distribution. You may not copy the
Software except as necessary to exercise your rights under this
Agreement and to make one (1) copy of the Software in machine readable
form for back-up or archival purposes only. You may not translate,
reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, modify or create derivative
works based on the materials, except as expressly permitted by the law
of this Agreement.  You may modify the Software and/or merge it into
another program solely for your use in accordance with this Agreement.
Any portion of the Software merged into another program will continue
to be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.  Except
for the distribution of runtime versions of the software ("Runtimes")
in accordance with the following paragraph, this license does not
permit the distribution of the Software, or any part thereof, to any
third party.

6. Distribution of Runtimes. You may not copy or distribute any
Runtimes.

7. Purchase Orders. You agree to pay the appropriate license fees to
the Vendor within thirty (30) days of the invoice date. Acceptance of
the Software shall be deemed to occur on the tenth day after
shipment. In no event shall the terms of any purchase order become
binding on the Vendor even if an acknowledgment copy is signed by the
Vendor.

8. Ownership; Confidentiality. You acknowledge and agree that the
Software contains the confidential and proprietary information of the
Vendor and its licensors and is provided solely under the terms and
conditions of this Agreement.  All right, title and interest in and to
the Software, including, but not limited to, patent copyright, trade
secret, trademark and all other intellectual property rights are and
shall remain in the Vendor or its licensor. You shall not remove any
product identification, copyright notices, or other legends set forth
on the Software and shall reproduce all such notices on any copies.
You shall have no right in the Vendor's or its third party licensors'
trademarks in connection with the Software, or with its promotion or
publication, without the Vendor's prior written approval.

9. Limited Warranty. The Vendor warrants for a period of thirty (30)
days from the date of original delivery that (a) the Software will
perform substantially in accordance with the accompanying user
documentation when used as described therein; and (b) that the media
containing the Software will not prove defective under normal use.
The Vendor does not warrant that the Software will be error free or
that the Software will meet your requirements.  The Vendor's sole
responsibility under this warranty will be, at its option, (1) to
replace at no additional charge any defective media containing the
Software that are returned within the thirty (30) day warranty period
or (2) to use reasonable efforts to correct errors that are reported
to the Vendor within the foregoing warranty period or (3) to refund to
you license fees paid for use of the Software.
THE REMEDIES SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 9 ARE YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE
REMEDIES AT LAW OR IN EQUITY FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY. TO THE MAXIMUM
EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE VENDOR DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES OR
REPRESENTATIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF QUALITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.

10. Limitation of Liability. EXCEPT IN RESPECT OF PERSONAL INJURY OR
DEATH CAUSED BY THE NEGLIGENCE OF LISPWORKS LTD OR ANY OTHER LIABILITY
WHICH MAY NOT BE EXCLUDED BY LAW IN NO EVENT SHALL THE VENDOR OR ITS
LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF BUSINESS, LOST
SAVINGS LOSS OF DATA OR ANY DIRECT OR INDIRECT SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES EVEN IF THE VENDOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES IN ADVANCE.  IN NO EVENT SHALL THE
VENDOR'S LIABILITY EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF LICENSE FEES PAID BY YOU FOR
USE OF THE SOFTWARE. NOTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT LIMITS LIABILITY FOR
FRAUDULENT MISREPRESENTATION.

11. US Government Restricted Rights. This Software is a commercial
computer software program developed at private expense and is provided
with restricted rights. The Software provided herein may not be used,
reproduced, or disclosed by the Government except as set forth in this
EULA and as provided in DFARS 227.7202-1(a), 227.7202-3(a) (1995), FAR
12.212(a)(1995), FAR 52.227-19, and/or FAR 52.227-14 Alt III, as

Cowley Road, Cambridge CB4 0WS, UK. You agree to include this Notice
in any software application, including any associated documentation,
you distribute using this Software, in whole or in part.  Rights
reserved under the copyright laws of the United States.

12. Statutory Rights. This license gives you specific legal rights and
you may also have other rights that vary from country to country. Some
jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, or
certain kinds of limitations or exclusions of liability, so the above
limitations and exclusions may not apply to you. Other jurisdictions
allow limitations and exclusions subject to certain conditions. In
such a case the above limitations and exclusions shall apply to the
fullest extent permitted by the laws of such applicable
jurisdictions. If any part of the above limitations or exclusions is
held to be void or unenforceable, such part shall be deemed to be
deleted from this Agreement and the remainder of the limitation or
exclusion shall continue in full force and effect. Any rights that you
may have as a consumer (that is, a purchaser for private as opposed to
business, academic or government use) are not affected.

13. Export Control. You may not export or re-export the Software or
any underlying information or technology except in full compliance
with all applicable laws and regulations of all applicable countries.

14. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance
with the laws of England and the parties submit to the non-exclusive
jurisdiction of the English courts.

15. Non-Assignment; Entire Agreement. Except as in accordance with
this Agreement, you shall not sell, assign, sublicense or otherwise
transfer the Software without the Vendor's prior written consent. Any
such attempted transfer shall be void.  This Agreement constitutes the
entire agreement between the parties and supersedes all other
communications between the parties relating to the subject matter
hereof.  This Agreement may only be modified by a writing signed by
the Vendor.

16. Termination. The Vendor may terminate this Agreement if you fail
to comply with any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

or return to the Vendor all copies of the Software.
