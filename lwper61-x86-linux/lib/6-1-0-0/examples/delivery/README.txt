Delivery examples
-----------------

Various examples illustrating how to deliver a runtime.

See README.txt files in the sub-directories for more details.


Notes: 

In the README.txt files, "Use X as delivery script" (when X is a file
name) means either:

1) Use the file path as a command-line argument with -build, i.e. run
   LispWorks from a console like this:

     <LispWorks-image> -build X
 
or

2) Use the script in the Application Builder tool in the LispWorks
   IDE. Either edit the file and enter Meta+X Build Application, or
   start the Application Builder tool and enter the file path in the
   Build script pane.
