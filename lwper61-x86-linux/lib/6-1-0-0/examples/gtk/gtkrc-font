### #<harlequin copyright marker>

### Examples of how to change the font used by the LispWorks IDE.
### These can be added to the file ~/.gtkrc-2.0 or some other gtkrc
### file in your configuration.

### For available fonts, run fc-list.

### The names of all LispWorks IDE interfaces are prefixed by
### "Lispworks.". By prefixing all the paths by Lispworks., these
### declarations ensure that they match widgets only inside the
### LispWorks IDE.


### This shows how to change the font for all panes in LispWorks,
### except for any editor pane whose font is overridden by the
### settings in Preferences > Environment > Styles in the LispWorks
### IDE.

style "LispWorks-font"
  {
  	font_name="Courier 12"
  }
widget "Lispworks.*" style "LispWorks-font"


### This shows how to change the font for all buttons in LispWorks.
### The .* is needed at the end because GTK+ buttons contain a
### separate label widget, which is where the actual font resides.

style "LispWorks-button-font"
  {
  	font_name="Courier 12"
  }
widget "Lispworks.*.push-button.*" style "LispWorks-button-font"
widget "Lispworks.*.button.*" style "LispWorks-button-font"
