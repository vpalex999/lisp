#| Configuration file for choosing which Motif library to use.

NOTE: THIS FILE IS NO LONGER USED BY LISPWORKS IN THE DEFAULT CONFIGURATION.

This file should contain a single Lisp plist of items with keys as follows:

:detect-version
  A plist for detecting which version of Motif is installed.  The keys of this
  plist are filenames and the values are the symbols :motif or :lesstif.  If
  exactly one of the files exists, that version of Motif will be used.  If
  more than one of the files exists, the value of the :prefer-version item is
  used to choose (or the the first one is used if :prefer-version is not
  given).

:prefer-version
  If the :detect-version item is missing then this item provides the default
  version to use.  This item is also used when more than one file exists in
  the :detect-version list.
